                  President Trump shifted tone on his trade war with China yet
                  again on Monday, calling President Xi Jinping of China a
                  “great leader” just three days after branding him an “enemy”
                  of the United States. Mr. Trump said that Chinese officials
                  had reached out by telephone and that the two sides would soon
                  restart trade talks, after the latest escalation in tariffs
                  and his “order” to American companies to look for ways to pull
                  out of China. “We were called and we’re going to start very
                  shortly to negotiate,” Mr. Trump said as he met with President
                  Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt on the sidelines of the Group of
                  7 summit meeting in Biarritz, France. “We’ll see what happens,
                  but I think we’re going to make a deal.” Mr. Trump appeared to
                  be toning down a conflict that has battered world financial
                  markets, hours after China’s chief negotiator did the same.
